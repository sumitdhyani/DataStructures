This directory contains the templates for unbalanced BST, Balanced BST(Red Black Tree), Rank Tree and Weighted BST.
Weighted BST is the one which allows the insertion of duplicate elememts and also tells the element with a particular rank.
For example, if the elements inserted are 1,1,6,4,4,2 and the client code asks the elemt with rank 3, then 2 will be returned.

THe interface is Templated so the client code can make a variety of trees according to its own requirement such as 
RB-RankTree, Unbalanced-RankTree, RB-Weighted Tree etc.

The limitation with Weighted BST in this implemetation is that it assumes that the duplicate elements are identical.
So it keeps the element and the count, not the individual elements with same key.
